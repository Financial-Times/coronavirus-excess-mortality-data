# Excess mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic

This repository contains excess mortality data for the period covering the 2020-21 Covid-19 pandemic. The data has been gathered from [national, regional or municipal agencies](#sources) that collect death registrations and publish official mortality statistics. These original data were reshaped into a standardised format by Financial Times journalists to allow cross-national comparisons, and have been used to inform the [FT’s reporting on the pandemic](#stories).

The repository contains the excess mortality data for all known jurisdictions which publish all-cause mortality data meeting the following criteria:

* daily, weekly or monthly level of granularity
* includes equivalent historical data for at least one full year before 2020, and preferably at least five years (2015-2019)
* includes data up to at least April 1, 2020

Most countries publish mortality data with a longer periodicity (typically quarterly or even annually), a longer publication lag time, or both. This sort of data is not suitable for ongoing analysis during an epidemic and is therefore not included here.

## Data

All of the data can be found in the file [data/ft_excess_deaths.csv](https://github.com/Financial-Times/coronavirus-excess-mortality-data/blob/main/data/ft_excess_deaths.csv).

## Data definitions

For each jurisdiction and each weekly or monthly period, the data contains the following fields:

* `country`: the country to which the data applies
* `region`: where applicable, the subnational or administrative region. This duplicated `country` for national-level data
* `period`: the period for which the data is collected. This can be “week” or “month”; data reported daily has been aggregated into weeks
* `year`: the year within which the period ends. The is the same as the year element of the `date` field.
* `month`: the month within which the period ends. This is the same as the month element of the `date` field.
* `week`: week number is either taken exactly from countries’ own data, or is calculated using the following method: for countries reporting daily data, we take the most recent run of seven days in the data to be the most recent week, and then aggregate each prior seven-day run into a new week, with any trailing period fewer than seven days at start of January clipped off
* `date`: the date at which the week ends
* `deaths`: historical daily, weekly or monthly numbers of all-cause deaths for as far back as we have been able to obtain this data
* `expected_deaths`: the expected number of deaths for the same place and period, adjusted for recent trends in mortality and population growth
* `excess_deaths`: difference between `deaths` and `expected deaths` (negative values indicate fewer deaths than expected)
* `excess_deaths_pct`: `excess_deaths` as a percentage of `expected_deaths`

## Stories

"Excess mortality" refers to the difference between deaths from all causes during the pandemic and the historic seasonal average. For many of the jurisdictions shown here, this figure is higher than the official Covid-19 fatalities that are published by national governments each day. While not all of these deaths are necessarily attributable to the disease, it does leave a number of unexplained deaths that suggests that the official figures of deaths attributed may significant undercounts of the pandemic's impact.
